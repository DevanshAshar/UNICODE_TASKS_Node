# UNICODE_TASKS_Node
In the First task I have performed the Code using logic and knowledge of coding in loops,if-else,arrays,strings,sorting etc.
In the Second task I have first created a database in MongoDB using fetch function and the URL provided. Then imported the database and the collection and used express to print the whole database. Also created a different function which prints the characters from database of category==bettercallsaul.
In the Third task I have used post method to add a new ccharacter to the database and also print the database using get
In the Fourth task I have used Delete method to delete a character from the database by passing the char_id of that Character in the request and have also created a put function to update the details of a character by passing his name in the body
